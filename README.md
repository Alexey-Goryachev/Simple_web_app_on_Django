# Simple_web_app_on_Django
This is a small site with authors and their quotes.

To launch the application:

1. Install all necessary packages and extensions.

2. Go to the project folder (quotes) and
run the command python manage.py runserver from there in the console.

3. We go to the local host, and use the site.

The application implements authentication. Users who have registered and logged in have access to additional functionality in the form of adding new authors and new quotes.
